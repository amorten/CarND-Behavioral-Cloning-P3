# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This is the third project in Udacity's Self-Driving Car NanoDegree program. I have successfully used deep learning to train the car to drive within the lane lines using behavioral cloning. I still need to create a write-up for this project.
At the moment, the all of the code is found in the IPython notebook

[deep_learn_driving.ipynb](deep_learn_driving.ipynb).

As part of the project I wrote a writeup,

[writeup.md](writeup.md), <-- TODO: doesn't exist yet!

that describes my solution. 

For completeness I have included the original README for this project provided by Udacity as

[README_Udacity.md](README_Udacity.md)
