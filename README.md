##**Behavioral Cloning Project**

###The Project
---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
  
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images  
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set  
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road  
* Summarize the results with a written report



### The Files
---

The project includes the following files:  

* [model.ipynb]() - contains the script to create and train the model (my contribution)
* [drive.py]() -  a script for driving the car in autonomous mode (created by Udacity)
* [model.h5]() - contains a trained convolution neural network, created by [model.ipynb]()
* [writeup_report.md]() - describes the the project in detail 
* [video.mp4]() - the video output showing the car driving autonomously around the track

Please refer to [writeup_report.md]() for detailed information about this project.

Look at [model.ipynb]() to see the code that trains the model.


Watch [the video](./video.mp4) output to see the car successfully drive around the track!


For completeness I have included the original README for this project provided by Udacity as [README_Udacity.md](README_Udacity.md).
